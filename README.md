# Alejandro Rodriguez-Garcia

## PhD Student in Computational Neuroscience at Newcastle University

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am Alejandro Rodriguez-Garcia, a highly motivated PhD student at Newcastle University, under the supervision of Dr. Srikanth Ramaswamy in the Neural Circuits Laboratory. My research is primarily focused on how neuromodulation shapes continual learning in artificial neural networks. I am particularly interested in spiking neural networks (SNNs) with neural heterogeneity and cell-specific neuromodulatory effects.

### Research Interests
- **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs):** Exploring the dynamics and computational power of biologically inspired neural models.
- **Neural Heterogeneity:** Investigating the diversity of neural responses and their implications for learning and memory.
- **Neuromodulators:** Studying the impact of neuromodulatory systems on neural plasticity and network behavior.
- **Computational Neuroscience:** Applying computational methods to understand the brain's complex processes.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Developing models to simulate learning and decision-making in both biological and artificial systems.
- **Deep Learning:** Leveraging deep neural networks for advanced data analysis and pattern recognition.

### Academic Background

I hold a Master’s degree in Biophysics from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, where I worked on developing a reinforcement learning model to study dopamine's role in learning and motivation. This project provided valuable insights into how dopamine influences motivation and learning processes in the brain.

### Current Projects

At Newcastle University, I am currently engaged in a project that aims to enhance the learning capabilities of artificial neural networks by incorporating insights from neuromodulation. By integrating cell-specific neuromodulatory effects and neural heterogeneity, we aim to develop more efficient and adaptable neural networks, addressing some of the key challenges in the field of artificial intelligence.
